    <h3>About the Lighthouse:</h3>

    <p>
      The price is monitored by a <strong>Lighthouse</strong> contract. A Lighthouse is a type of oracle.
      The Lighthouse contract has the price of <span c-network-units></span> in USD pushed to it periodically by
      third party volunteers who run the Lighthouse's Java application.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this way anyone can query the Lighthouse to see if the current prices is greater or equal to the <strong>target price</strong>
      (this only has to happen once). The Lighthouse MUST be queried from the hodlers club contract when the
      current price greater than or equal to the <strong>target price.</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The club can also be <strong>disbanded</strong> if 50% of the members vote to disband.
      A reason for disbanding is because the Lighthouse is no longer reliable.
      Only those marked Mature can vote. If the club is disbanded there is no penalty or reward for leaving the club.
