      A hodlers club is a smart contract (DApp) which lets you lock up your <span c-network-units></span>
      until a target price in USD is reached. The Dapp is designed for anyone who wishes to avoid impulse
      selling because of FUD.
      "Cowards" who leave the club before the price is reached, leave behind a small
      percentage of their <span c-network-units></span> which is shared amongst the "Mature Hodlers" (e.g. hodlers
      who have waited for the target price to be reached).
      So by joining the club, you can hodl your coins until they Moon and maybe get a few extra coins if Cowards
      leave.
    </p>

    <h3>How it Works</h3>
    <p>
      First someone will create a new hodlers club contract. A club will
      have a <strong>target price</strong> in USD, a <strong>minimum buy in</strong>
      in <span c-network-units></span>, <strong>penalty percentage</strong> for
      how much <span c-network-units></span> is left behind by Cowards and the <strong>number of blocks until maturity</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is or will be many hodlers clubs on this site all marked for different target prices, penalties, etc...
    </p>

    <p>
      Other people will join the club by sending the <strong>minimum buy in</strong> to become new members.
      New members are called "Immature Hodlers." Each Immature Hodler has to wait at least the
      <strong>number of blocks until maturity</strong> to then mark themselves as mature by clicking the
      "Mark as Mature" button. <small>In fact anyone can mark anyone else as mature after the right
      number of blocks and its nice if club members help each other in this way.</small>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: Club member can always add more coins to their initial hodlings and there is no fee to join a club.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any member who leaves the club before the target price is reached is a <strong>Coward</strong> and leaves
      behind <strong>penalty percentage</strong> of their hodlings to be shared between the
      <strong>Mature Hodlers</strong> and the <strong>Admin</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the target is reached, everyone still in the club is a "Hodler" and will be able to withdraw all
      of the coins they put into the contract without penalty. Those that are marked mature will also share
      any coins left by <strong>Coward</strong>s.
    </p>
